# Robotics-Assignment-4

Problem:
Given a known bounded environment, that has some convex obstacles.
We have to traverse two robots, from their respective start positions to
their goals, while keeping both the robots in each others sensing range.
The metric designed for this will minimise time to reach each of theirs
goals (minimise path lengths) and avoid obstacles.
Both the goals are less than the sensing range distance apart.

Solution:
Using Consrtained RRT's
